# holberton school c

## Low Level Programming & Algorithms
welcome to my low level C programming experience at Holberthon School. Here I Will be documenting what i have  learning througs a series of projects Holberthon is a project based learning environment

## Goals

- Learning about low level C code by building many function from the ground up
- Will not use stdlib in the first few sets of problems
- Build our own, shell possibly in a spearte project
- Build our own printf statement, possibly in a seperate project
